        "\n",
        "**What is data augmentation?**\n",
        "Have you ever lost your glasses and then squinted, or tried to look through a rainy window? Or looked at a false color image, maybe a forest where the trees are blue and the sky green? You can usually make an educated guess what you are looking at, even though the image you see is different than usual. This is, essentialy, what data augmentation is. It's the same data, still recognizable, but slightly altered in some way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is that useful for?**\n",
        "Let me begin with an anecdote that you've probably heard in the lectures. Say you have pictures of cats and dogs, and want your model to tell the two apart. How many people you know go to the park with their dogs? I imagine many. Hence, many images of dogs are dogs lying on the grass. The same is generally untrue for cats, at least I have never heard of anyone walking their cat to the park. At any rate, here is what happens when I train a neural network on these images: The model takes a shortcut. It sees a lot of green and the correct answer for these pictures is always \"Dog\". It learns \"Green = Dog\". This is what we call overfitting. We have overfitted to the existence of green in the background as a quintessential part of what makes a dog. Sometimes, we get away with this, if our data always has this correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now I get some new data. A bunch of people have taken pictures of their cats, sunbathing on the terrace. The garden is in the background. Lots of green. The model, in its infinite wisdom, will at first guess that these images are of dogs. Clearly, our model's ability to tell apart cats and dogs has not generalized to this new dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "So how can we prevent the model from taking shortcuts and encourage learning information that generalizes? We force these generalizations in training. If I gave you an image of a dog, but the grass was brown, and the dog green, you could still identify it as a dog, instead of a cat, right? And so should the model, if we can manage it. So let's also make it train using pictures of cats and dogs where the colours are different or removed. Suddenly, the shortcut solution is no longer useful, and the model must rely on shape, texture, or contextual information like a leash. The practice of color change described is a practical and useful data augmentation that is used in state-of-the-art image recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to color changes, there is a myriad of other techniques, such as cropping, image rotation or flipping, edge filters, solarization, random noise, and many, many more. Basically, anything that you believe may eventually show up in testing data and that you want the model to generalize to, can be made into a corresponding data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How do we use data augmentations in practice?**\n",
        "There are two ways of adding data augmentation during training. Either, you can implement it inside of your dataset, so that it only returns augmented image tensors, or right before feeding your image tensors into your model. Both options are acceptable and come with advantages and disadvantages, although the more common way is to separate dataset and augmentations. We also showcase the native PyTorch way of augmenting data below.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are particularly eager, or want to try your hand at making image augmentation functions yourself, it can be fun and is definitely good practice. However, PyTorch comes with a large selection of image augmentations right out of the box, and in the following chapter, we will look at how to make use of them."

        "#### Chapter 3.2 - Regularization Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are multiple definitions or guidelines for what regularization is supposed to do (see lectures), in terms of practical concerns, all regularization techniques have the same aim, expressed through different means: Improving some aspect of the performance of your deep learning models. We differentiate them, broadly, from data augmentations, because regularization techniques generally concern themselves with the learning process, e.g. loss function modifications, learning rate optimizations, temporary model modifications, etc., and *not* the underlying data in our model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of different strategies, far too many to list all of them here, but a few particularly successful ones have made it into common use - so much so that they are more prevalent than regularization-less, \"vanilla\" deep learning. These fall into different groups, briefly discussed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Additional Loss Components\n",
        "\n",
        "The loss function for any given modern optimization task is typically continuous and not always smooth everywhere. As a consequence, there are many different parameter configurations in a model that result in the same train-time loss. Not all of these express the same behavior during training or testing, however. When we modify our loss to penalize certain training behaviors, we allow the training process to select for models and parameters that give models that generalize better, converge to a solution faster, etc.,  despite often expressing the same training loss. Let's look at some examples that should be familiar from the lecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "**L1 Loss** - Often also called LASSO, L1 Loss is a penalty term added to the normal loss during training, which is defined as:\n",
        "$L_{LASSO} = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} |\\Theta_{P}|$. Growing linearly with parameter magnitude, we penalize the model. This, in turn, forces the model to use fewer and smaller weights - relying on more weights than it needs, and thus probably overfitting, is disincentivized. Similarly, we just forced our model to stick to weights near zero, which we already know is generally a preferable area for model activations to stick to.\n",
        "\n",
        "**L2 Loss** - L2 Loss is the more popular cousin of the L1 Loss, which does approximately the same thing, except the penalty is equal to the sum over all squared parameter magnitudes: $L_{LASSO} = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} |\\Theta_{P}|^2$ The reasoning behind it is similar, but it has seen far more practical adoption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weight Decay** - An operation that effectively performs the same duty, weight decay reduces the magnitude of weights after each backward pass, for example by subtracting a small constant or multiplying with a factor. In essence, this eliminates parameters which are rarely \"used\" and were thus likely involved in overfitting on a small amount of data anyway. Parameters that are regularly updated (and therefore probably useful), will always remain near their optimal value despite weight decay. Interestingly, Weight Decay is mathematically equivalent to L2 Loss in terms of net parameter updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Training Strategies\n",
        "**Early Stopping**: For early stopping, we monitor the performance of the model on a validation set and stop training when the performance stops improving. This ensures that the model does not continue to train on the training data and potentially overfit, while also saving computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique where, during training, a random subset of neurons in a layer is \"dropped out\" (set to zero) for each forward pass. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons and encourages it to learn more robust and generalized features. During inference, all neurons are used, but their outputs are scaled to account for the dropout during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Rate Scheduling (LR Scheduling)**: Learning rate scheduling involves dynamically adjusting the learning rate during training. A high learning rate at the start helps the model converge quickly, while a lower learning rate later allows for fine-tuning. Common strategies include step decay, exponential decay, and cosine annealing. Proper learning rate scheduling can lead to faster convergence and better generalization."

        "\n",
        "Batch Normalization is a technique to improve the training of deep neural networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer. It was introduced to address the problem of internal covariate shift, which refers to the change in the distribution of layer inputs during training as the parameters of the previous layers change.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Intuition:**\n",
        "The idea behind Batch Normalization is to normalize the inputs to each layer so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that the inputs to each layer are on a similar scale, which helps the network learn faster and more effectively. By normalizing the inputs, Batch Normalization reduces the sensitivity of the network to the initialization of weights and allows for the use of higher learning rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1. For each mini-batch, Batch Normalization computes the mean and variance of the inputs.\n",
        "2. The inputs are then normalized using these statistics:\n",
        "    $\\hat{x} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\epsilon}}$\n",
        "    where $\\mu$ is the mean, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance, and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant added for numerical stability.\n",
        "3. To allow the network to learn the optimal scale and shift for the normalized inputs, two learnable parameters, $\\gamma$ (scale) and $\\beta$ (shift), are introduced:\n",
        "    $y = \\gamma \\hat{x} + \\beta$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problems it solves:**\n",
        "1. **Internal Covariate Shift:** By normalizing the inputs to each layer, Batch Normalization reduces the changes in the distribution of layer inputs during training, making the optimization process more stable.\n",
        "2. **Faster Training:** Normalized inputs allow for the use of higher learning rates, leading to faster convergence.\n",
        "3. **Regularization Effect:** Batch Normalization introduces some noise due to the mini-batch statistics, which acts as a form of regularization and reduces the need for other regularization techniques like Dropout."

While it is no longer in use today, the lessons learned from AlexNet very much are, and multi-GPU setups and deep convolutional neural networks remain a staple of computer vision methods.\n",

Even though it is far from the strongest model available today, its flexibility, modest size, and robust performance across tasks makes it a favorite, both in general computer vision and medical computer vision, where it is commonly used as the encoder in segmentation models (more on that later). The original paper (https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) has garnered almost 300'000 citations, and its descendants have dominated challenges and paper submissions in the field for a significant amount of time.\n",
